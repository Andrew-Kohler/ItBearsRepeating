%Well, well, well. Agent June Cole. Once again, you find yourself at mercy of Crimson Cosmonaut.
%SILENCE!
$*sigh* As always, Agent Cole, I hold hope that you will see merit of my vision...
$...and free yourself from chains your country places upon you.
%But until then, chains I use to bind you are sadly necessary.
%Do you practice annoying quips in mirror before you come break in, or does it just come naturally?
$Your irritating nature is unfailingly consistent, Agent Cole. 
%But today, I surpass anything you or your government could ever hope to tell me.
%The device you see before you is time machine.
$It is DR.ORLOV, you disrespectful swine!! I will trigger death trap early if you do not, as Americans say, ZIP IT.
%But yes, I invented time machine.
$Your dedication to foiling plans of present has caused me to look beyond moon of today. 
$USSR of past was flawed, corrupted by men of greed and little substance. Is why it fell.
%But if I, Dr. Klara Orlov, woman of science and skill, champion of workers everywhere -
$- if I were to intervene in history, right its course at every step...
%...then space race would be won decades before Sputnik. Utopian communist society could be formed on Earth and Moon.
%No risk. Today, humanity has benefit of unlimited retries.
%Whatever good they had, they will come to know better.
$Ah! Is true, Agent Cole. For long time, crucial flaw in time machine plan was risk of erasing myself from timeline. 
$No little Klara, no Crimson Cosmonaut.
$But finally, I find solution. In beautiful Pacific Northwest of your country, rare berry grows in this forest. 
$When exposed to time travel energy, it creates field which eliminates paradoxes.
$I will be free to travel history, and little Klara's existence will be of no consequence. 
@I will be woman out of time - just as you are, right now.
